## 📖 Overview

Terra Scout is an autonomous exploration and resource-finding system designed to operate inside Minecraft environments. The agent learns to efficiently locate diamond ore through reinforcement learning, adapting its strategy based on experience rather than hardcoded rules.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop an autonomous agent capable of independent exploration
- Enable intelligent decision-making without predefined paths
- Efficiently locate diamond ore in unknown environments
- Minimize unnecessary actions, risk, and wasted time
- Demonstrate learning and adaptation over repeated runs
